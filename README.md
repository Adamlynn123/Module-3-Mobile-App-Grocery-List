# Module-3-Mobile-App-Grocery-List
# Overview

The purpose of creating this app is to gain knowledge on app development and trying to learn new programming languages. I decided to go with Kotlin as my programming language because it is easier to understand and it is becoming more popular than Java in recent years. 

My app is a simple grocery list, although you can use it for other things, the purpose is to add items onto a list and when you are done with said items, you can check them and delete them from the list.

# Development Environment

To create this project I used Android Studio and created a blank mobile app project.

Kotlin is the programming language used in this app.

# Useful Websites

# Future Work

* Including a way to sort the list would improve the app to make it more functional.
* Another ambitious feature that I think would be awesome is organizing each item on 
the list according to its aisle in a specific store or at least general area.
